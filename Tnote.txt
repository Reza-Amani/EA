A simple strategy- 
  trend-based
		-recognising the trend
		-entry point
		-sl/tp
		-exit/trailing stops
		-end of trend detection

H2 is highly correlated with L1. so, meeting both conditions L1 low and H1 high is unrealistic
Hence, lower L1 encourages lower H2. As a result, working on L1 entry is not a good idea.
Also, I remember that close is not predictable.
Maybe, the only realistic idea is open price then sl and tp on H1 and L1
